# rt_rt

RT is a ray tracing project developed as part of the 42 School curriculum. This project aims to create computer-generated images using the ray tracing rendering technique, which simulates the behavior of light rays in a virtual scene.

## Features

- Generate images using the ray tracing method
- Support for at least four simple geometric objects: plane, sphere, cylinder, and cone
- Apply translation and rotation transformations to objects
- Manage view redrawing without recalculating the entire scene
- Position and direction of the camera and objects
- Light management: brightness, shadows, multi-spot lighting, and shine effects
